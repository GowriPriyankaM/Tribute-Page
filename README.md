## Description :

The purpose of a Tribute page is to provide a brief overview about someone we admire in our lives. In this project, with the help of **HTML** and **CSS**, I have built a responsive **Tribute Page for Raja Ravi Varma** who is considered as one of the greatest painters in the history of Indian art. I have created this project as a part of my Responsive Web Design certification in FreeCodeCamp curriculum. 

## Structure of the Webpage :

#### Intro Section : 

  This section consists of a picture and a brief introduction about Ravi Varma.
#### About Section : 
  
  This section gives an insight about Raja Ravi Varma's profession and background.
#### Quote Section : 
  
  The following section is merely comprised of a quote by Ravi Varma.
#### Gallery Section : 
  
  This section shows some of the famous paintings of Ravi Varma along with a wikipedia link at the end to know more info about him.
#### Footer : 
  
  It contains a github profile link of the designer and developer of this page.
  
## Challenge :

- Due to this being my first Responsive Web page, I had a difficult time selecting the right layout depending on the device's screen size.

## Contributions :

If you want to contribute to the project, follow the below steps.

#### 1. Fork the Repository :

On the project's GitHub page, click the "Fork" button at the top right corner. This creates a copy of the project under your own GitHub account.

#### 2. Clone the Repository : 
      
Once you've forked the repository, you'll want to have a local copy of it on your machine. 
 
To do this, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your desired directory, and run the following command.
 
```
 git clone https://github.com/username/Tribute-Page.git
```
 
Here, replace "username" with your GitHub username.
 
#### 3. Create a Branch : 
      
It's good practice to create a new branch for your contributions. This keeps your changes isolated from the main project. 

Run the following command to create and switch to a new branch.

```
 git switch -c your-branch-name  
```
      
Replace "your-branch-name" with a descriptive name for your branch.

#### 4. Make Changes : 
      
Open the project in your preferred text editor or IDE and make the necessary changes or additions to the code, documentation, or other project files.

#### 5. Commit Changes : 
      
After making your changes, save the files and go back to the terminal or command prompt. 

Use the following command to stage your changes for commit.  

```
 git add file-name
```

This command adds all modified and new files for commit. If you want to add specific files, replace "file-name" with the file names.

Next, commit your changes with a descriptive commit message.

```
 git commit -m "Your commit message"
```

#### 6. Push Changes : 

Push your local branch with the committed changes to your forked repository on GitHub using the following command.

```
 git push -u origin your-branch-name
```

Replace "your-branch-name" with the name of the branch you created earlier.

#### 7. Create a Pull Request : 

Once your changes are pushed to your forked repository on GitHub, You should see a message suggesting you create a pull request. 

Click on the "Compare & pull request" button and provide a clear title and description for your pull request, explaining the changes you've made and submit it.

Soon I'll be merging all your changes into the main branch of this project. You will get a notification email once the changes have been merged.

*Congratulations! You have successfully contributed to the project.*
