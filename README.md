# Tribute-Page
## Description
For this project, with the help of basic HTML and CSS, I have built a responsive **Tribute Page for Raja Ravi Varma** who is considered as one of the greatest painters in the history of Indian art. I have created this project as a part of my Responsive Web Design certification in FreeCodeCamp curriculum.
