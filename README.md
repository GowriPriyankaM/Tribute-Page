# Tribute Page

## Description :

The purpose of a Tribute page is to provide a brief overview about someone we admire in our lives. In this project, with the help of **HTML** and **CSS**, I have built a responsive **Tribute Page for Raja Ravi Varma** who is considered as one of the greatest painters in the history of Indian art. I have created this project as a part of my Responsive Web Design certification in FreeCodeCamp curriculum. 

## Structure of the Webpage :

- **Intro Section :** 

  This section consists of a picture and a brief introduction about Ravi Varma.
- **About Section :** 
  
  This section gives an insight about Raja Ravi Varma's profession and background.
- **Quote Section :** 
  
  The following section is merely comprised of a quote by Ravi Varma.
- **Gallery Section :** 
  
  This section shows some of the famous paintings of Ravi Varma along with a wikipedia link at the end to know more info about him.
- **Footer :** 
  
  It contains a github profile link of the designer and developer of this page.
  
## Challenge :

- Due to this being my first Responsive Web page, I had a difficult time selecting the right layout depending on the device's screen size.

## Contributions :

if you want to contribute to the project, follow the below steps:
1. Fork the Repository: On the project's GitHub page, click the "Fork" button at the top right corner. This creates a copy of the project under your own GitHub account.
2. Clone the Repository: Once you've forked the repository, you'll want to have a local copy of it on your machine. To do this, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your desired directory, and run the following command, replacing [username] with your GitHub username.
3. Create a Branch: It's good practice to create a new branch for your contributions. This keeps your changes isolated from the main project. Run the following command to create and switch to a new branch, replacing [branch-name] with a descriptive name for your branch.
4. Make Changes: Open the project in your preferred text editor or IDE and make the necessary changes or additions to the code, documentation, or other project files.
5. Commit Changes: After making your changes, save the files and go back to the terminal or command prompt. Use the following command to stage your changes for commit:  
This command adds all modified and new files for commit. If you want to add specific files, replace . with the file names.
Next, commit your changes with a descriptive commit message:
6. Push Changes: Push your local branch with the committed changes to your forked repository on GitHub.
7. Create a Pull Request: Once your changes are pushed to your forked repository, visit the original project's GitHub page. You should see a message suggesting you create a pull request. Click on the "Compare & pull request" button to start the process.
Provide a clear title and description for your pull request, explaining the changes you've made. If there are any relevant issues or discussions, reference them in your pull request.
