# Tribute Page

## Description :

The purpose of a Tribute page is to provide a brief overview about someone we admire in our lives. In this project, with the help of **HTML** and **CSS**, I have built a responsive **Tribute Page for Raja Ravi Varma** who is considered as one of the greatest painters in the history of Indian art. I have created this project as a part of my Responsive Web Design certification in FreeCodeCamp curriculum. 

## Structure of the Webpage :

- **Intro Section :** 

  This section consists of a picture and a brief introduction about Ravi Varma.
- **About Section :** 
  
  This section gives an insight about Raja Ravi Varma's profession and background.
- **Quote Section :** 
  
  The following section is merely comprised of a quote by Ravi Varma.
- **Gallery Section :** 
  
  This section shows some of the famous paintings of Ravi Varma along with a wikipedia link at the end to know more info about him.
- **Footer :** 
  
  It contains a github profile link of the designer and developer of this page.
  
## Challenge :

- Due to this being my first Responsive Web page, I had a difficult time selecting the right layout depending on the device's screen size.
