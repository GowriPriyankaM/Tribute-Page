                            <p>Raja Ravi Varma is considered among the greatest painters in the history of Indian art. His works are one of the best examples of the fusion of European academic art with a purely Indian sensibility and iconography. He was known as the first modern Indian artist.</p>

                    <div class="article">
                        <p>Ravi Varma was notable for making affordable <b>lithographs</b> of his paintings available to the public, which greatly enhanced his reach and influence as a painter and public figure. His lithographs increased the involvement of common people with fine arts and defined artistic tastes among common people. Furthermore, his religious depictions of <b>Hindu deities</b> and works from <b>Indian epic poetry</b> and <b>Puranas</b> have received profound acclaim. He was part of the royal family of erstwhile Parappanad, Malappuram district.</p>
                        <p>Raja Ravi Varma was closely related to the royal family of <b>Travancore</b> of present-day <b>Kerala</b> state in India. Later in his life, two of his granddaughters were adopted into the royal family, and their descendants comprise the present royal family of Travancore, including the latest three Maharajas (Balarama Varma III, Marthanda Varma III and Rama Varma VII).</p>
